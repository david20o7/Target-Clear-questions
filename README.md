This question extends the functionality of the Skeleton Program to introduce difficulty levels to the game.
Introduce the functionality to have "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" levels in the standard random game.
Introduce a list of "Large" numbers [ 25, 50, 75, 100 ]. The application should populate the numbersAllowed list as follows:
| Game Mode | How many "Large" numbers | How many standard random numbers |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Standard | 0 | 5 |
| Easy | 1 | 4 |
| Medium | 2 | 3 |

The functionality should produce a brand-new set of numbersAllowed for each turn even if the user expression does not evaluate to a target.
This functionality is not applicable to a training game.
