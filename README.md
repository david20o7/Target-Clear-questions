# Task 5

**Marks: 4**

This question is about the use of the values in the numbersAllowed list. The application currently awards the same number of points regardless of the complexity of the expression entered by the user. This does not encourage mathematical extension and challenge.

Introduce functionality into the application to give a bonus of 2 points for every operand used in the expression entered, if the evaluation is a valid target.

## What you need to do

### Task 5.1

Modify the `checkIfUserInputEvaluationIsATarget` method to operate as described.
**[3 marks]**

### Task 5.2

Test that the changes you have made work:

- Run the Skeleton Program.
- Enter y to start a training game.
- Enter the expression: 512/8+2+2
- Show the program correctly identifying the target 68 and increasing the user score to 7 points (6 additional points for four operands used in the expression).
  **[1 mark]**

## Evidence that you need to provide:

- Your PROGRAM SOURCE CODE showing the amended `checkIfUserInputEvaluationIsATarget` method.
- SCREEN CAPTURE(S) showing the required tests.
